# NFT Auction Smart Contract

## Project Description

The *NFT Auction Smart Contract* is a decentralized platform enabling the auctioning of ERC-721 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. NFT owners can initiate time-bound auctions, allowing participants to place bids using Ether. The contract ensures trustless, secure, and transparent bidding and asset transfer.

## Project Vision

To provide a gas-efficient and transparent mechanism for NFT owners to conduct fair, trustless auctions without relying on centralized platformsâ€”empowering creators and collectors globally.

## Key Features

- *ERC-721 Support:* Integrates with any compliant NFT contract.
- *Fair Bidding:* Only higher bids are accepted, and previous bidders can withdraw their funds.
- *Time-Bound Auctions:* Owners define a custom duration for each auction.
- *Secure Transfers:* NFTs are securely held by the smart contract until auction completion.
- *Transparent Events:* Emits detailed events for bids, withdrawals, and results.

## Future Scope

- *Dutch & Sealed-Bid Auction Types:* Support multiple auction models for different strategies.
- *UI Integration:* Develop a frontend DApp using Web3.js or Ethers.js for interaction.
- *Auction History & Metadata:* Store past auction data and NFT details on-chain or via IPFS.
- *Multi-NFT Auctions:* Allow bundling of multiple NFTs for a single auction.
- *Royalties Support:* Integrate ERC-2981 to support automatic royalties to creators.
